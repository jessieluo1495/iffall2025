        <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
        <p>
            Club queen on the downtown scene<br>
            Prowling around at night<br>
            You're not mean, you just want to be seen<br>
            Want to be wild<br>
            A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright<br>
            You want in but you just can't win<br>
            So you hang in the lights</p>
        <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
        <p>
            You're so Art Deco, out on the floor<br>
            Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure<br>
            Baby, you're so ghetto<br>
            You're looking to score<br>
            When they all say hello<br>
            You try to ignore them<br>
            'Cause you want more (why?)<br>
            You want more (why?)<br>
            You want more (why?)<br>
            'Cause you want more<br></p>
        <p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
        <p>
            Young thing on the downtown scene<br>
            Rolling around at night<br>
            Got things that have yet to be seen<br>
            Like you're rapper's delight<br>
            A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright<br>
            You want in, but you just can't win<br>
            So you stay in the lights<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
        <p>
            You're so Art Deco, out on the floor<br>
            Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure<br>
            Baby, you're so ghetto<br>
            You're looking to score<br>
            When they all say hello<br>
            You try to ignore them<br>
            'Cause you want more (why?)<br>
            You want more (why?)<br>
            You want more (why?)<br>
            'Cause you want more<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
        <p>
            A little party never hurt no one<br>
            So you stay out late<br>
            A little party never hurt no one<br>
            That's what your friends say<br>
            You put your life out on the line<br>
            You're crazy all the time<br>
            Put your life out on the line<br>
            You're crazy all the time<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
        <p>
            You're so Art Deco, out on the floor<br>
            Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure<br>
            Baby, you're so ghetto<br>
            You're looking to score<br>
            When they all say hello<br>
            You try to ignore them<br>
            'Cause you want more (why?)<br>
            You want more (why?)<br>
            You want more (why?)<br>
            'Cause you want more<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Outro]</strong></p>
        <p>
            A little party never hurt no one<br>
            Not you and me<br>
            A little party never hurt no one<br>
            We were born to be free<br>
        </p>
