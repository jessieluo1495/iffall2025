            <h1>Impressionalism (1870s-1880s)</h1>
            <p>Impressionalism was a movement launched by an exhibition in 1874 organized by a group of artists called the Anonymous Society of Painters. Some of the founding members include Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro. Their works in the exhibition is widely recognized today for its modernity, rejecting realistic art and incorporating new ideas and technologies. The impressionalism technique is characterized by large, visible strokes, applying pure, unmixed colors.</p>

            <h1>Eastern European Influences <br>(early 20th century)</h1>
            <p>Abstract art emerged in the early 20th century and at this time, art was primarily dominated by fauvism, cubism, and figurative expression. These type of art styles broke the boundaries oftraditional representational art and had freedom in its color, shapes, and subject. There was a lot of boldness and experimentation with colors. </p>
            <p>During this time, there was the first abstract watercolor painting by Wassily Kadinsky, a Russian painter linked to the avante-garde movement in Eastern Europe. </p>
