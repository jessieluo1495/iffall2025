There were many art movemments that floursihed during this time including: Suprematism, Constructivism, Russian Futurism, Cubo-Futurism, Zaum, Imaginism, and Neo-primitivism. It is known for its bold experimentation and rejection of traditional artistic conventions. Artists like Kazimir Malevich were very influential during this time, greatly changing the way Western art is now as they broke free from representational art and embraced geometric, abstract forms.</p>
            <p>This movement was at its peak particularly during Russian Revolution of 1917, where new ideas of avant-garde clashed iwth socialist realism.</p>
