    <h2>Title: Strawberry Tiramisu</h2>
    <h3>Description: A heavenly dessert with layers of ladyfingers, fresh strawberries, and fluffy whipped cream.<br> It is no bake and super refreshing for the summer!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon orange zest</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup strawberry jam</li>
            <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>7 ounces crisp ladyfingers</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather and prepare all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Slice the strawberries and zest the orange. Cut zested orange in half and juice it.</li>
            <li>In a bowl (large enough to dip the ladyfingers), whisk together the strawberry jam and orange juice together. You can add 1-2 teaspoons of water if the mixture is too thick. Put mixture aside for now.</li>
            <li>Next, mix the mascarpone with the orange zest in a bowl. Set this aside for now.</li>
            <li>Whip together the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl with a mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. This can take about 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the whipped cream with the mascarpone mixture. Then, continue to fold the remainder.</li>
            <li>Dip the ladyfingers into the jam mixture, and make sure to coat all sides. Then arrange the ladyfingers over the bottom of an 8x8 inch baking dish. May have to cut some in order to fit the dish. </li>
            <li>Spread half of the whipped cream/mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Then, layer half of the sliced strawberries over the mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layering process with the remainder ladyfingers and whipped cream/ mascarpone mixture. Save some sliced strawberries on side for decoration later.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge overnight (at least 8 hours) for the ladyfingers to soften.</li>
            <li>When it is ready to serve, take it out of the fridge and add the remaining sliced strawberries on top.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>Three Links to Recipe Websites</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/dutch-baby-pancake-with-apples-recipe-11796790">Martha Stewart</a>: This site is very simple, clear, and engaging. It gives a good summary at the beginning regarding the prep time, cook time, and servings. There is good typographic hierarchy where larger text is used for titling the website page, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. There is also a review section at the end!</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/strawberry-tiramisu/">Love & Lemons</a>: Right below the title and short description of the dish, there is a text that says "Jump to Recipe" and when you click it, it lets you skip the fluff and go directly to the ingredients and directions section. This is great for viewers who like to get to the point, and it allows for easier navigation. For the step to step instructions portion, the type styling was effective as each step has a bolded title along with an image.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.gordonramsayacademy.com/en/uk/recipes/calvados-toffee-apple-pancakes-recipe">Gorden Ramsay Academy</a>: A very simple and clear layout. Very easy to follow and all the information can be seen on the screen without scrolling so you can cook without touching the computer. However, the only thing is that I would like pictures along with the instructions even though it would require scrolling.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Three Links to Non-Recipe Websites</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.choptsalad.com/">Chopt Salad</a>: A colorful, exciting, and clear website. Not only is it visual exciting, it is easy to navigate. There are many interactive elements, for example, when I put my cursor above the "Explore Our Menu" section, cute graphic designs appear behind the pictures. The type is very cohesive and there is good typographic differentiation between titles and descriptions.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en">Guggenheim Bilbao</a>: The front page is very engaging since it incorporates a video showcasing the museum. Typography is clear where the name is bolded and is the first thing to show when clicking on this website. The website tools are easy to navigate and minimalistic.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.ideo.com/">Ideo</a>: Very minimalistic and gets straight to the point. The type is consistent throughout the website and it is used creatively throughout (for example: type in motion). Not too many words on one page and everything is very organized.</p></li>
    </ol>
